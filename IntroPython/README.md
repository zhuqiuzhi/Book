#美亚上的评论：

> This is an insightful and fast-paced intro to Python, written by an experienced master coder. 
> It's written for coders (unlike the plethora of basic Python books on the market). 
> The very first chapter presents a non-trivial 9-line Python program that pulls and prints 
> top-rated videos from the Youtube site (the code works). The book covers many of the language 
> features as well as areas such as web programming, databases, and concurrency. 
> The book is a pleasure to browse through: an intelligent and informed writer writing for an intelligent readership. 
> After reading this book one will be ready for Wesley Chun's "Core Python Applications Programming."


> This book is good for experienced programmers to study Python and has plenty of contents to
> learn. Packages of various fields are explained, with those of similar function listed. So this book
> can be used for reference. Reader will be exposed to the various computing fields advancing currently.
> In my own opinion, it may be better to discuss NoSQL database, Queue usage and NetWork with ZeroMQ
> package more in real practice scenarios. And the meaningful words and little jokes interspersed in the
> book make it more attractive than purely describing a programming language.
